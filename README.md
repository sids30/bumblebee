Welcome to the Durham College Chatbot. DCBot (Not affiliated)

# Intro
This is a chatbot created by implementing Langchain and Retrieval. DCBot uses my web-scraped data from a few of the Durham College web pages that its users frequently visit. I hope you like the results!

# Required Libraries
Please install and import the following libraries to use DCBot:

- Langchain
- NLTK
- OS (built-in)
- Pandas
- Huggingface-hub

To install, go to your device's terminal or command line interface and type:

# pip install langchain nltk pandas huggingface-hub


# Note

- You must also have any of the dependencies to the above packages installed.

- The retrieval process may take up to a minute sometimes if the question is long. Please be patient.
