# DCBot
Welcome to the Durham College Chatbot. DCBot (Not affiliated).

# Intro
This is a chatbot created by implementing Langchain and Retrieval. DCBot uses my web-scraped data from a few of the Durham College web pages that its users frequently visit. I hope you like the results!

# Required Libraries
Please install and import the following libraries to use DCBot:

- Langchain
- NLTK
- OS (built-in)
- Pandas
- Huggingface-hub

To install, go to your device's terminal or command line interface and type:

# pip[3] install langchain nltk pandas huggingface-hub


# Note

- You must also have any of the dependencies to the above packages installed.

- Questions asked must be found within the scraped links, or the model will generate a general, often incorrect answer at the end of the retrieval chain. 

- A HuggingFaceHub Read or Write token. It can be created using a free account on their website. Find it here after you have logged in "https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens".

- The retrieval process may take up to a minute sometimes if the question is long. Please be patient.


# PS
This was initially created as a final project for a Data Management course for AI. Please bear with me for future updates as this will be a side project of mine from now, till I can make it better and easily usable for others. My wish is to one day provide DCBot to Durham College as my first contribution since starting as a member of the amazing, selfless community of Python programming and AI.
